XOR key:

x^x = 0
x^0 = x
x^y = y^x



Suppose we are at node C, we can get the address of node D as shown below

	addr(B) ^ link(C)
	= addr(B) ^ (addr(B) ^ addr(D))
	= 0 ^ addr(D)
	= addr(D)

The XOR operation cancels addr(B) appearing twice in the equation, all we have left is the addr(D).



FIRST...similarly, to get address of first node, we XOR the value in the link field with NULL

	NULL^link(A)
	= NULL ^ (NULL ^ addr(B))
	= 0 ^ addr(B)
	= addr(B)



LAST... to get the address of the last node D in the linked list, XOR the D's link field value with NULL

	NULL^link(D)
	= NULL ^ (addr(C) ^ NULL)
	= 0 ^ addr(C)
	= addr(C)


ith ... to get the ith node's address, say node C

	addr(D) ^ link(C)
	= addr(D) ^ (addr(B) ^ addr(D))
	= 0 ^ addr(B)
	= addr(B)
